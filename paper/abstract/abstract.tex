\begin{abstract}
In this project, a finite element model is developed for a modified wave equation that includes both a damping term
and a forcing term. A demonstration was built using various modern web technologies, including JavaScript and WebGL.
Later sections describe those technologies, explain how they were used in building the simulation, and mention some
of the issues encountered, along with how they were overcome or avoided altogether.
