\section{Summary}
In summary, I have built a real-time simulation of the wave equation using Finite Element Analysis that runs completely
natively in the browser. A finite element solution was derived, and then analyzed for error. Open-source tools were
utilized to help build a robust, well-tested architecture, and to increase development productivity. Lastly, current
caveats were explored and potential solutions explored.

For future work, I'd like to remove the convex restriction and use any polygon. Lastly, I believe many of the components I've built are mostly reusable,
so I would like extract those components into reusable chunks for consumption by other developers and myself in later
projects.
