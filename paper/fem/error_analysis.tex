\subsection{Error Analysis}
It is certainly useful to know the stability of the scheme chosen in \label{eq:finite_diff_solution}, so that we can
choose appropriate time step values to prevent numerical instability. We'll first consider apply some algebra to
\label{eq:finite_diff_solution}, which gives us a somewhat simpler form
\begin{equation}
c^{n+1} = \left(
    \frac{4}{2 + \gamma\delta t} - \frac{2\beta^2\delta t^2}{2 + \gamma\delta t}
\right) c^n
-
\frac{2 - \gamma\delta t}{2 + \gamma\delta t}c^{n-1}
+
\frac{2\delta t^2}{2 + \gamma\delta t}\vec{F}
\end{equation}

For the purposes of our error analysis, we'll assume that no force is being applied, since in our simulation it's
assumed the user won't provide force the entire time. We'll let $r = \frac{1}{2 + \gamma\delta t}$. Considering the
error $\epsilon^{n+1}$, we have
\begin{equation}
|\epsilon^{n+1}| = |4rI - 2\beta^2\delta t^2rM^{-1}A||\epsilon^n| + (2 - \gamma\delta t)r|\epsilon^{n-1}|
\end{equation}
Worst case, the error did not decrease, meaning $|\epsilon^{n}| = |\epsilon^{n-1}|$, which allows to to consider the
scaling of the scheme
\begin{equation}
\frac{|\epsilon^{n+1}|}{|\epsilon^{n}|}
\le
\frac{4 - 2\beta^2\delta t^2|M^{-1}||A| - 2 + \gamma\delta t}{2 + \gamma\delta t}
\le
1
\end{equation}

After some cleanup, we have
\begin{equation}
\frac{-2\beta^2\delta t^2|M^{-1}||A|}{2 + \gamma\delta t} \le 0
\end{equation}

Since all of the terms are positive, then our scheme is unconditionally stable
