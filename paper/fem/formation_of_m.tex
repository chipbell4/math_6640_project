\subsection{Formation of $M$}

- Mention only two triangles shared really matters
- Integrating $\phi_k$ and $\phi_j$ over region sucks
- Perform a change of variables transformation and then integrate over a nicer region (cite this method)
    - Derive transformation matrix given $N_i, N_j, N_k$
    - Multiply $\phi_j \phi_k$ by the transformation, converting to $(u,v)$ coords. Don't forget the Jacobian.
    - Perform integration, find generic form for single triangle
    - Generalize to be able to handle two triangles (shared) between nodes.
