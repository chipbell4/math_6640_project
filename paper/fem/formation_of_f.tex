\subsection{Formation of $\vec{F}$}
In this simulation $F(x,y,t)$ will be provided by the user in real-time, via mouse clicks. This being said, we have a
choice in how we want to translate a mouse click into a function $F(x,y,t)$. In fact, for simplicity we can bypass
$F(x,y,t)$ altogether and simply consider $\vec{F}$.

In fact, given a mouse click at $(x,y)$ at time $t$, we'll choose the nearest $n$ nodes to $(x,y)$ and subdivide some 
weight $W$ to those nodes proportional to their distance from $(x,y)$. This would mean $n$ of the entries of $\vec{F}$
are non-zero but the rest are zero. Also, $\sum\limits_i\vec{F}_i = W$.
