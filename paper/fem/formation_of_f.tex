\subsection{Formation of $\vec{F}$}
In this simulation $F(x,y,t)$ will be provided by the user in real-time, via mouse clicks. This being said, we have a
choice in how we want to translate a mouse click into a function $F(x,y,t)$. In fact, for simplicity we can bypass
$F(x,y,t)$ altogether and simply consider $\vec{F}$.

In fact, given a mouse click at $(x,y)$ at time $t$, we'll choose the nearest $n$ nodes to $(x,y)$ and subdivide some 
weight $W$ to those nodes proportional to their distance from $(x,y)$. This would mean $n$ of the entries of $\vec{F}$
are non-zero but the rest are zero. In fact, a parameterized form of this weighting can be written as follows
\begin{equation}
w(N_k) = \frac{W}{T|N_k - C| + 1}
\end{equation}
where $N_k$ is some node point, $W > 0$ is some weighting factor, $T > 0$ is a ``tightening term'' and $C$ is the center
point of force application. Note that 1 is added to prevent the denominator from being 0.
