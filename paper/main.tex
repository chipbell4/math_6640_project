\section{The main PDE}
Here is the main partial differential equation:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2} + \gamma \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
=
\beta^2 \nabla u + F(x,y,t)
\end{equation}

where $u$ is the wave height at some point $(x,y)$ at some time $t$, $\gamma$ is a damping factor for the wave,
$\beta$ is the wave speed, and $F$ is a forcing function on the wave.
