\section{The main PDE}
The partial differential equation models a damped membrane over a region $\Omega$ bounded by a closed curve $\Gamma$.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:main_pde}
\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial t^2} + \gamma \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
=
\beta^2 \nabla u + F(x,y,t)
\end{equation}

where $u$ is the wave height at some point $(x,y)$ at some time $t$, $\gamma$ is a damping factor for the wave,
$\beta$ is the wave speed, and $F$ is a forcing function on the wave. Because this a drum head, (or ``membrane''), we choose
$u$ along $\Gamma$ to be 0, giving us a Dirichet boundary condition.
