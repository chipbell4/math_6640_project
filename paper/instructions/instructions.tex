\section{Instructions}
The project is hosted on my personal website \cite{hosted_site}. The source control for the project is hosted on Github
\cite{github}. Follows is a basic set of instructions and description of how the application works.

The first screen allows the user to draw a polygon (defaulting to a square). When a user presses a key, the polygon is
triangulated and the simulation begins. Triangulation is accomplished by first converting the polygon to a convex form,
then sampling latice points for point containment within the polygon. Once this point set has been obtained, is
triangulated using the Delaunay triangulation and converted into a mesh.

Using the mesh, the mass and stiffness matrices are calculated. The LU factorization of the mass matrix is also
calculated and stored for later operations requiring the inverse. Once these matrices are calculated, the numerical
scheme is stepped in real-time.

To add energy to the system, clicking on the mesh applies force to the system. This force is calculated by an inverse
square relationship to the click center, and adjusting the click weight and tightness will adjust the amount of force
and spread of force respectively. Also, other parameters of the system are adjustable, including wave speed,
elasticity, and damping.

As a note, sometimes an error will occur. Simply refresh the page if that occurs
